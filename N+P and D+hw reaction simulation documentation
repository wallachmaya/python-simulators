    	This project was made to simulate two-body interactions like Photodisitegration, Capture, Internal Conversion emission of a light quantum, and Scattering. One simulated 
situation is neutron-proton reactions. This is when a neutron and proton collide which can result in scattering or capture. The other circumstance is when a deuteron and 
photon react. This is when a deuteron and photon collide which results in scattering, photodisintegration, internal conversion, or light quantum emission.

                      						Information about the Reactions

    	Scattering is when subatomic particles interact with each other and the incident particle is deflected. If the incident particle has the same energy as it did before 
it's called elastic scattering. When the energy is different then it's inelastic. Also, when a photon is being scattered it's called Compton scattering. In this project when it 
mentions the probability of scattering it means the probability of both elastic and inelastic scattering.

    Capture is when a nucleus and neutron collide to form a heavier nucleus. This can result in the emission of a gamma-ray.

    Photodisintegration is when a photon collides with a nucleus (in our case a deuteron) and the nucleus emits one or more particles. Typically the higher the photon energy 
the lower the probability of the reaction occurring.

    Internal conversion is when an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with orbital electrons of the atom. This causes the electron to be emitted from the atom.

    Light quantum emission is when an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of the atom. This will cause a light quantum to emit.

                              					    What does the code do?

    The code runs the simulation of neutron-proton collisions and photon deuteron collisions. After every test, the program outputs the probability of each reaction occurring, 
the reaction that did occur, the number of times each reaction has occurred, the energy of the incident particle, and for N+P -> D+hw reactions it shows how much energy was 
generated from the reaction. An example of the output for the neutron-proton collision simulation is:

Test 177
1.713909039645192 Kilo Joule
['cap M']
[0.20283624036693002, 0.79716375963307]
The magnetic radiation emitted per second 6.346021679750686e-39
66 112

    The top line shows the test number, the second line shows the amount of energy the incident particle had in Kilo Joules, the third shows the reaction that occurred in that
test, the line below that shows the probability of each reaction happening, the second to last line shows how much energy was emitted from the reaction in MeV, and the final 
line shows how many times each reaction had previously occurred in the order: magnetic dipole capture then scattering.

An example of the output for the photon - deuteron collision simulation is:

    The top line shows the test number, the second line shows the amount of energy the incident particle had in eV, the third shows the reaction that occurred in that test, the 
line below that shows the probability of each reaction happening, the second to last line shows how much energy was emitted from the reaction in MeV, and the final line 
shows how many times each reaction had previously occurred in the order: magnetic dipole photodisintegration, Compton scattering, light quantum emission, then internal 
conversion.
