    This project was made to simulate a few two-body interactions like Photodisitegration, Capture, Pair Production, and Scattering. One 
simulated situation is neutron-proton reactions, this is when a neutron and proton collide which, results in scattering or capture. The 
other possible circumstance is deuteron-photon reactions. This is when a deuteron and photon collide which, results in scattering, 
photodisintegration, or pair production.

    Scattering is when two particles interact and the incident particle is deflected. If the incident particle has the same energy as it 
did before, it's called elastic scattering but, if the energy is different then it's inelastic. When a photon is being scattered, it's 
called Compton scattering. In this project, the probability of scattering means the probability of both elastic and inelastic scattering.

    Capture is when particles collide and merge to form a heavier nucleus, this can result in the emission of a gamma-ray.

    Photodisintegration is the process of photons colliding with nuclei (in our case a deuteron) and the nucleus emits one or more 
particles. Typically, the higher the energy of the photon the lower the probability of the reaction occurring.

    Pair production is when a positron and electron are created from a photon after it collides with a nucleus, sometimes it leaves 
it in an excited state.

                                                    What does the code do?

    The code simulates neutron-proton collisions and photon deuteron collisions. After every test, the program outputs the 
probability of each reaction occurring, the reaction that occurred, the amount of times each reaction has occurred, the energy 
of the incident particle, and for N+P -> D+hw reactions it shows the amount of energy generated from the reaction. An example of 
the output for the neutron-proton collision simulation is:

Test 34
0.7 Kilo Joule
['cap E']
[0.0012584582126272963, 0.04609235713000955, 0.9526491846573631]
1.442065269444526e-39 1.442065269444526e-39 in MeV
4 149 2663

    The first line shows the test number, the next line shows the amount of energy the incident particle had in Kilo Joules, the third 
shows the reaction that occurred, the line below shows the probability of each reaction happening, the second to last line shows 
how much energy was emitted from the reaction in MeV, and the final line shows how many times each reaction had previously occurred 
in the order: electric dipole capture, magnetic dipole capture, then scattering.

An example of the output for the photon-deuteron collision simulation is:

Test 34
3.7e-17 eV
['pair production']
[0.16175548168930473, 1.1643702050307509e-17, 0.42910624486861837, 0.4091382734420769]
81 0 68 108

    The top line shows the test number, the next line shows the amount of energy the incident particle had in eV, the third shows the 
reaction that occurred, the line below that shows the probability of each reaction happening, and the final line shows how many 
times each reaction had previously occurred in the order: electric dipole photodisintegration, magnetic dipole photodisintegration, 
Compton scattering, then pair production.
